Meeting with Abassi (4-5):

Question 1:
Yes, the nested structure is essential. XSD is not W3 standard. But the one in

Question 2:
It's up to us. One command with a semicolon is the usual. If you want to buffer the commands that fine.
You're commit could be the end of the command.

Question 3:
Yes, typical databases are auto commit. But you could buffer the commands if you want. It'd be nice to turn it off.

semicolon is say commit regardless.

Question 4:
Is that difficult? In reality it doesn't matter. It's case sensitive when checking the table structure.

Question 5:
Table is going to come from XSD and XML. There is a translation from XSD to SQL datatypes

Question 6:
Your database is going to empty at start. You can show this in the presentation.
CHAR(3) is for all the key fields.

Question 7:
Insert duplicates? Yes insert the duplicate with only a change the date and time.

Extra work:
Auto-commit is a good idea.
Capturing System date and time.


String maximum size.
integer maximum size.
decimal maximum size and precision that removes from maximum.
date (Date format? written in XSD MM:DD:YY[YY] for initial any other change is extra)

Meeting with Abassi (3-29):
Other teams are getting smaller

Question: 1
No, Single User database

Question: 2
Check the syntax and show an error (Informative or Uninformative)
-Bad syntax could stop the processing if we wanted too
You could do a two stage insert, in which errors don't cause a permanent changes in database

Question: 3
No, XML is going to be converted into SQL commands. The SQL engine is able to handle all the commands

Side on XML:
XML is a datafile that contains records and their fields.
XSD shows how the XML should be formatted.
You're not using this to generate a create table command.
If the table doesn't exist, show the error.
The XML is just going to be converted into sql statements that can be run against this database.

Question: 4
Anything you want.

Question: 5
Your choice. Except that your database files will be in external files. The LOAD DATABASE can pull those external files. The SAVE DATABASE will create the external files.

Question: 6
No, you cannot store your data in Oracle.

Question: 7
You could do it. It gives flexibility. Otherwise you could do a CSV.

Notes:
XSD could be contained in XML, It's not recommended.
Abassi could have multiple XML and XSD file that he could load multiple times.

When you get a job, START A ROTH IRA.
